career-profile:
    title: About Me
    summary: |
      I have been professionally involved in IT projects and products for 15 years. The first half of them I grew up from software engineer to CTO. 
      The second half I spent on entrepreneurship and participation in several products. These were the local and international products. Also I made few own products.
      My experience allows me to combine a business vision and goals with technical approaches and knowledge for success executing them.
      As a team leader of product I try to transparency with my teammates. I like planing and data-driven decisions. Besides I appreciate an integrity and punctuality in my work.

      I am especially proud of my work at the international startup Appscotch and my experience of building a million-dollar VKontakte product.
      - With a strong small team we made Appscotch product that was used by such giants as Google, Activision, Uber, etc. Later the company was acquired by Appannie / Data.ai.   
      - Into vk.com a small team and me jointly build a product with an MAU of 14 million users, tens of thousands of sellers and year revenue of 12 million dollars.
